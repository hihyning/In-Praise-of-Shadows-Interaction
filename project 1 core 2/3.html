        <span class="text black-text">Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove,</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text">For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface upon which the faint,</span>
        <span class="text black-text"> and in it a hanging scroll and a flower arrangement.</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> frail light can play; it performs precisely the same function as the sand-textured wall.</span>
        <span class="text black-text new-line"> But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows.</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text">This is why we attach such importance to age and patina.</span>
        <span class="text black-text">We value a scroll above all for the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, </span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> A new painting, even one done in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, </span>
        <span class="text black-text">and thus we consider the mounting quite as important as the calligraphy or painting.<span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text">can quite destroy the shadows of an alcove,</span>
        <span class="text black-text">Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to blend with the alcove,</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> unless it is selected with the greatest care.</span>
        <span class="text black-text new-line">while a work of no particular distinction may blend beautifully with the room,</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> A Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting,</span>
        <span class="text black-text"> and set off to unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings.</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> the paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest,</span>
        <span class="text black-text new-line"> Wherein lies the power of an otherwise ordinary work to produce such an effect?</span>
        <span class="text black-text"> Most often the paper, the ink,</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> and the alcove where it is darkest.</span>
        <span class="text black-text"> the fabric of the mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity,</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese room,</span>
        <span class="text black-text"> and this look of antiquity will strike just the right balance</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> I marvel at our comprehension of the secrets of shadows,</span>
        <span class="text black-text">  with the darkness of the alcove and room.</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> our sensitive use of shadow and light.</span>
        <span class="text black-text">  We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples of Kyoto or Nara,</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever device.</span>
        <span class="text black-text">  of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove.</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever device.</span>
        <span class="text black-text">  So dark are these alcoves, even in bright daylight,</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that the light drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness.</span>
        <span class="text black-text">  that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we can do is listen to the explanation of the guide,</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> There is nothing more.</span>
        <span class="text black-text">  follow as best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be.</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the shelves,</span>
        <span class="text black-text">  Yet the combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony.</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> though we know perfectly well it is mere shadow, we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence;</span>
        <span class="text black-text">  The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting perfectly.</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> The "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners speak probably refers to the uncanny silence of these dark places.</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> And even we as children would feel an inexpressible chill as we peered into the depths of an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated.</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> Where lies the key to this mystery?</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> illtimately it is the magic of shadows.</span>
        <span class="text lightyellow-text"> Were the shadows to be banished from its comers, the alcove would in that instant revert to mere void.</span>
